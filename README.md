# inspec-reporter-json-hdf
InSpec Reporter Plugin to be used with Heimdall

This InSpec Reporter Plugin is developed under the SAF to extend security testing capabilities for the SAF shared community.

## Installation:

#### After installing InSpec, run this command to install this reporter plugin:
```
"inspec plugin install inspec-reporter-json-hdf" 
```
#### ...or if using cinc-auditor:
```
"cinc-auditor plugin install inspec-reporter-json-hdf" 
```

# Features:

## Manual Attestation
Sometimes requirements (i.e., "InSpec controls") in an InSpec profile require manual review, whereby someone interviews/examines the requirement and confirms (attests as to) whether or not the control requirements have been satisfied. These attestations can be provided to this profile as follow

### Usage:

#### Step 1: Simply add your attestations to a json file, such as "my_attestations.json":
```
{
    "plugins": {
        "inspec-reporter-json-hdf": {
            "attestations": [
                {
		"control_id": "2.1",
		"explanation": "Discussed with team to ensure a dedicated machine is running this instance of MySQL.",
		"frequency": "annually",
		"status": "passed",
		"updated": "2022-01-02",
		"updated_by": "Json Smith, Security"
                },
                {
		"control_id": "2.4",
		"explanation": "Discussed with team to ensure that neither default nor shared cryptographic material is not being used.",
		"frequency": "every3days",
		"status": "passed",
		"updated": "2022-04-09",
		"updated_by": "Json Smith, Security"
                },
                {
		"control_id": "9.1",
		"explanation": "Reviewed deployment with team to ensure replication traffic is secured and found some connections non-secure.",
		"frequency": "quarterly",
		"status": "failed",
		"updated": "2022-04-02",
		"updated_by": "Json Smith, Security"
                }
		]
        }
    },
    "version": "1.2"
}
```
#### Step 2: Run your InSpec profile as you normally would, but instead use the hdf reporter *AND* give it your attestations file via the --config flag:
```
inspec exec https://github.com/mitre/oracle-mysql-ee-5.7-cis-baseline/archive/master.tar.gz --reporter hdf:my_results.json --config my_attestations.json
```
#### Before and after attestation:
